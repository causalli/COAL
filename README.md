# COAL
Covariate selection is an essential task when faced with many variables in modern causal
inference in a data-rich environment. Particularly, the efficiency of the average causal effect
(ACE) can be improved by including covariates only related to the outcome and reduced by the
inclusion of covariates that are related to the treatment but not the outcome in the propensity score
(PS) model. The .r files implement the methods for censored outcome adaptive Lasso (COAL) to select covariates and estimating causal effect in the presence of censored outcome and
high-dimensional covariates.
